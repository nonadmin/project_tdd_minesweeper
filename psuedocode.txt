setup the game
- create board (10x10)
- - 
- randomly place 9 mines (populate array of mine coords)
- board should show remaining flags (can go negative, too many flagged)
render board
ask player for coords
ask player if coords are to be cleared or flagged
if coords are flagged, load into flagged array, re-render board
if coords are cleared, check for mine
- if no mine then begin checking all coords around for a mine
- - add numbers to cleared tiles that are adjecent to a mine
    a tile cannot be auto-cleared if its possibly a mine, creates the wall
- - re-render board with recursively cleared tiles
- if coords are a mine, game over
- - re-render board showing all mines

data being kept
mine coords
cleared coords
flagged coords
remaining flags count, can be negative

when clearing, if a numbered tile is met, so that is a tile adajecent to a mine
its number is revealed but we do not check the tiles around it
